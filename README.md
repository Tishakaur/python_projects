If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock.. (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended).<br> The rules are straightforward:
->Rock smashes scissors. <br>
->Paper covers rock. <br>
->Scissors cut paper.<br>
